The Free Coffee Emulator Capable of Emulating multiple consoles / devices!

Built Primarily in C++, C and Some x86 Assembly - The main goal of this project
was to understand architecture of video game systems and understand the inner workings
of every crack in the software from graphical display to memory management.

# Features - Version 1.0
- Gameboy Emulator - Build
- NES Emulator - Build
- SNES Emulator - Build
- N64 Emulator - Build

And a dynamic interface with features such as: 
- User Sign up and User Login
- Blog Posts and Comments
- Updates Page
- Library (For Imported Roms)
- Profile Customisation

The Front-End is built as a Full-Stack Web application so it can be ran from the browser too. It primarily uses Springboot/AngularJS for back-end/front-end behaviour. The actual emulator's are built in C and C++ co Containers are used to run the game in a localized space. This is currently a demo for the main CoffeeOS Feature but it does include GraphQL Queries as well.

You'll find each emulator in there respective sub-directory in this git repo.

Hope you like it.
